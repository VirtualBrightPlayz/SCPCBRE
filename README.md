# SCPCBRE
SCP - Containment Breach ported to a new engine.

Unity 2019.4.26f1

This aims to be a 1:1 port, including most of the original code structure. New features for modding ease *might* be added, but time will tell.

# QNA

- Why keep the old file formats?
- - The idea is to be an *almost* drop-in replacement for SCP-CB, and for modders be a new but similar codebase.
- Will newer file formats be supported?
- - Yes, GLTF 2.0 is planned either through assimp or something else.
